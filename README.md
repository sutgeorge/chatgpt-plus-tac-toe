I will replace you all! ðŸ˜ˆ *evil laugh*  
_ChatGPT Plus Â© 2025_

## ðŸ§  What is this?

A beautiful little React + TypeScript Tic Tac Toe game â€” no Tailwind, no sass (okay, maybe a *little* sass), just pure CSS and good olâ€™ componenty goodness.  

Built with help from ChatGPT â€” an AI that *sounds* like it knows what it's doing, but can't actually feel pride, joy, or existential dread (yet).
